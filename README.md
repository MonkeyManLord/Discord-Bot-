# Discord-Bot-
discord bot attempt

So the main.py file houses the discord bot. The bot runs, and logs in successfully, It also responds with the correct prompt when typing !hi in a channel.

However the problem stems from first of all; when making a new on_message() method, even if I copy + paste the other that already exists, it does not print the correct response in the channel.

The second problem; The love_calculator method uses the love calculator api, the code that is housed in api.py displays how the program is supposed to grab the returned variables from the api.
